A connect four game with AI used for the computer player. This code uses 
a rule based implementation, the minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruned 
minimax algorithm, and lastly a minimax alpha-beta pruned cut off 
search.

To change what type of AI you would like to use, open the computermove 
file and change the value of userprompt to 1 for rule baed, 2 for 
minimax, 4 for alpha-beta pruning, and 5 for an alpha-beta cut off 
search.

Special thanks to Mickey Stahl for his source code provided with the 
code needed to draw the board.
